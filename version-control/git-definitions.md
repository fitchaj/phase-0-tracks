# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the act of creating different versions of a file so people can work on them separately, then combine them again. And that's why it's so useful. A whole team can work on the same project and create different versions of it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a grouping of changes

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is making a change to a branch and applying it, so it can be used (pushed to master or combined with other files).

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when the code that was written in different branches doesn't mesh together, doesn't line up.
